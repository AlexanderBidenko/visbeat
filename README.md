####Note (Dec 13):
I haven't run this on anyone else's computer yet, but am going through a fresh install this afternoon and should have install instructions up by the end of the day (Dec 13).

####Update (Dec 13):
I was able to get th basic dancefer example working on a fresh debian install using:
pip install visbeat
but the requirements were non-trivial to sort out. It's being complicated through some combination of matplotlib, youtube-dl, and ffmpeg. I'll try to sort it out this weekend.
